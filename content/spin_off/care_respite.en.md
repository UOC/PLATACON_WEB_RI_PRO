    descripcio: >-
      Care Respite is a UOC spin-off whose **main product is a smart
      monitoring** system aimed at people who care for a dependent person. 


      It has been developed by researchers from the Centre de Visió per Computador (CVC), the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), the University of Barcelona (UB) and the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), i**n conjunction with the company Acceplan.** 


      The spin-off was created in 2016 by, among others, Xavier Baró Solé, a UOC researcher who belongs to the SUNAI research group. It **specializes in the field of computer vision**, specifically in facial and object recognition and the general understanding of environments. 


      Care Respite's technology is based on these capacities.
productes_serveis:
  - descripcio: >-
      It is a device based on **computer vision and artificial intelligence**
      that makes it possible to capture images of the dependent person, analyse
      their situation and position and, if a risk situation is perceived,
      activate a **system to immediately** notify their carer. 


      The system captures depth and audio signals, **ensuring visual anonymity**, in any room. 


      The product analyses these signals to detect risk situations, such as falls or atypical actions, and **activates an alert system**. 


      An app on their mobile phones allows their carers to receive these alerts, customize the system and remotely view **the detected behaviour.**
