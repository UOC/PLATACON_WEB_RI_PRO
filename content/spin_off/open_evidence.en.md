      Open Evidence is a research and consulting firm that designs and conducts studies on Social & Behavioural Sciences and Big Data Analytics. Open Evidence aims to improve the social and economic impact of public policies or operational performance in private business. 


      The spin-off was founded by Francisco Lupiañez, a researcher from the Open Evidence Group, in 2013, based on its know-how and state-of-the-art research related to understanding and predicting human behaviour, that often has several biases, and can even be irrational. At this point, the spin-off firm has contributed with real evidence to dozens of large-scale projects led by different public bodies, including the European Commission.
