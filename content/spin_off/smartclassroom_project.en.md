about:
  - descripcio: Smart Classroom Project develops and applies a unique methodology in
      the market based on the analysis, co-design, implementation and evaluation
      of learning spaces. This methodology built from the results of the
      research group to which its founders belong (Smart Classroom, from the UOC
      and UB) and validated by the market in more than 30 educational centers,
      acts on the following three dimensions - the environmental, the
      pedagogical and digital - from a multi-disciplinary perspective in which
      architecture, design, psychology and pedagogy intervene, always placing
      the focus on the well-being of the student and the teacher, and on their
      teaching-learning experience.
