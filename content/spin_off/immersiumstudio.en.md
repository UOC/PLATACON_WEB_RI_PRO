      **COVID-19 Skills Preparation Course:** VR training designed for the
      European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), funded by the
      European Commission. It offers knowledge and tools to healthcare
      professionals who do not usually work in the intensive care unit (ICU) to
      equip them with the skills to provide extra support to this unit during
      the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening European ICUs in times of need.

       It offers comprehensive tracking of the user's activity, by means of a scorecard associated **with actions/mistakes and reaction times.**

       **Family Approach:** VR training developed for the Donation and Transplant Institute (DTI) as part of its International Workshop on Transplant Procurement Management. Its aim is to train healthcare professionals how to give bad news to families and ask for consent for organ donation. 

      The user is confronted with a realistic situation in which they have to complete all the protocol steps necessary in this type of situation. The decisions made by the user take the experience down one plot path or another. The user receives customized comments on their actions, which are all monitored and registered for subsequent **analysis by the customer.** 


      **TPM Journey VR Training:** developed for the Donation and Transplant Institute (DTI) as part of its International Workshop on Transplant Procurement Management. With the aim of understanding the Spanish donation and transplant model, the user goes on a guided visit of a Spanish level three hospital. 


      The user visits the Transplant Coordination Office and sees the profiles of its members, its internal operation and its relationship with other key areas such as the accident and emergency department or the intensive care unit. They will also see the various transplant programmes (heart, kidney, pancreas, liver and lung) and visit the medical director of the hospital.

       The visit includes meetings with patients to see practical clinical cases at first hand.

       **Psychological support for families for the MPS Spain Association:** this non-profit organization aims to raise awareness about lysosomal diseases and support patients and their families, improve their quality of life and increase their social integration. A psychological care resource that uses 360º VR was co-created with the association's psychologist to help relieve suffering and treat associated psychological disorders following diagnosis or during the course of the disease.
