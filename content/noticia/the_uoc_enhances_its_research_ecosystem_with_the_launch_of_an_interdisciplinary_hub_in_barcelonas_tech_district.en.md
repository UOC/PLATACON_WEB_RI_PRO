    The Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) is developing a **new research ecosystem** to **promote** research, technological development and innovation in its **Can Jaumandreu** building, in the **22@** area of **Barcelona's** Sant Martí district. The hub aims to become **a leading centre of knowledge and frontier research**, working in line with the United Nations **2030 Sustainable Development Agenda**, which seeks to address the challenges facing **global societies** in the 21st century.


    The UOC was founded **[25 years](http://25.uoc.edu/)** ago as the world's **first fully online universit**y, with its **pioneering** use of the internet as **a teaching and research tool**. Having consolidated its position as a **leader in the knowledge society**, the University is now intent on reaffirming its commitment to R&I with the new 22@ research hub, which is expected to open in **2022**.


    Vice President **Aymerich** explained that "the hub will bring all the factions of the University's research and innovation activities together and promote synergies that will serve to increase the transfer of research results to society."


    The new research hub is supported by the **Government of Catalonia,** which is **co-funding the project** to the sum of **€1.25 million** as part of a grant scheme for the construction of singular institutional R&I facilities. The project includes the **redevelopment of 2,915 m2** of the building located at 103 Carrer de Bolívia, which will then become the main site for all the UOC's R&I activities.


     


    **Strengthening the three central strategic areas of UOC research**


    This ecosystem, based on **three core strategic areas of research** – **e-learning, e-health and the network society** – will unite many of the teams and facilities currently located throughout Barcelona and Castelldefels. This includes the **Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3)**, which specializes in the study of the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity; the **eHealth Center**, a transdisciplinary research centre focused on e-health; and the University's **e-learning research groups**.


    "The UOC's strategic areas of research seek to contribute to the exploration of the intersection between social sciences and technology and strengthen the two cornerstones of the welfare state: education and health," stressed **Aymerich**.


    The hub will not only unite the various different research centres and groups, but will also provide them with access to **key, pioneering facilities** in the Catalan region, with a focus on interdisciplinary **collaboration**.


    These include the **Data Science Lab** for the management and extraction of knowledge from big data; the **Media Lab,** which is involved with research, transfer and experimentation in the fields of digital communication, design and culture; the **Neuroscience Lab,** the neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience research space; and the **UOC Labs,** which are remote-access physical laboratories for experimentation that provide instruments, software, hardware and technological support required by researchers in the area of e-learning.


    The primary objectives of the new knowledge ecosystem include **establishing links with the principal Barcelona-based actors** (such as **companies** or other **research centres,** as well as the international actors and **universities** working in the 22@ district) and **attracting talent and funding both from Spain and the rest of the world**.


    In line with the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UOC's research hub will also promote **citizen participation** and encourage the dissemination of **scientific output** to raise public awareness regarding the relevance of scientific activity.


    Marta Aymerich: "The hub needs to work to connect the scientific world and the general public, disseminating research results and promoting citizen participation in relation to research projects."
