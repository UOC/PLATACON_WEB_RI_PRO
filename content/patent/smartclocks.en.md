      **Patent no. PCT/EP2016/067541**


      Priority date: 22/07/16


      SMARTCLOCKS is a novel, low-cost and energy-efficient method that aligns the clocks of wireless devices to guarantee improved synchronization accuracy by up to 10 times when compared to the current high-accuracy solutions while using 30% less energy.


      SMARTCLOCKS is able to align clocks to a reference with a drift compensation based on the device’s thermal characterization. It relies on sporadic clock realignment to a time source reference combined with adaptive drift rate prediction and automatic compensation using two correction tables.


      SMARTCLOCKS maintains highly accurate synchronization without any external time source or dedicated communications to synchronize devices.


      SMARTCLOCKS is the perfect solution for data collection scenarios where accurate synchronization and a reduction of energy consumption are vital.


      SMARTCLOCKS provides the following advantages:


      * Improves current high-accuracy synchronization solutions by up to 10 times

      * Minimizes communication overhead caused by synchronization problems

      * Optimizes TDMA network reliability with 100% efficiency

      * Consumes 30% less power


      SMARTCLOCKS technology is protected by the “Drift correction in a wireless network” international patent application.

      <!--StartFragment-->


      SMARTCLOCKS is a technology that benefits telecommunication companies in general, but particularly those devoted to the design of integrated circuits (ASIC) and wireless communication protocols. SMARTCLOCKS is a reliable alternative to be used in low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), which enable the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).
