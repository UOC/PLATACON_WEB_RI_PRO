      **SMARTCLOCKS is a low-cost and energy-efficient method** that aligns the clocks of wireless devices to guarantee improved synchronization accuracy (by up to ten times when compared to current high-accuracy solutions) **while using 30% less energy.** 


      **The solution combines** the sporadic synchronization of the clock, which takes place during data transmissions, with a correction calculated taking into account the prediction of the time drift due to temperature, **based on the device's thermal characterization.**
