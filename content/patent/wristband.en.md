    descripcio: This contribution is focused on the performance evaluation of a
      long-range patch-type antenna for ultra-high frequency (UHF)
      radiofrequency identification (RFID) wristband tags. The antenna design
      was presented in the IEEE International Conference on RFID Technology and
      Applications (RFID-TA), held on September 4-6, 2023, Aveiro, Portugal,
      under the title “A durable and flexible, low-cost tag antenna design for
      UHF RFID wearable applications”. First, the theoretical and practical
      evaluation of the wristband tag antenna is conducted in four different
      scenarios. Next, the studied solution is benchmarked against a selection
      of the current commercial solutions. The proposed antenna design is
      mounted on a flexible and low-cost Teflon (PTFE) substrate, and it
      consists of a disconnected metal-substrate-metal layered structure. To
      produce a light and comfortable wearable device, the wristband design
      constraints limit the thickness to 1 mm and the width to 3 cm. The design
      is intended to be used in human identification and tracking applications
      while providing enough durability to endure for a prolonged period without
      significant antenna de-tuning. The proposed wristband is designed to
      operate in the FCC band (902-928 MHz) and it can reach distances over 3–5
      meters, depending on the microchip sensitivity. The results of the
      experiments show that the performance of the proposed wristband design is
      comparable to current commercial solutions, while offering a different set
      of features. A discussion on the comparison between the current solutions
      and the proposed wristband antenna is provided in the text.
