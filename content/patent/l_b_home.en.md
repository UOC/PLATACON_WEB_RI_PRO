      Patent nº.: ES2636650 B1 Priority date: 04/05/2016 Lab@Home is a platform
      developed for the teaching of basic analogue electronics skills. 


      This **tool allows electronics** students to learn hands-on about the design and assembly of electronic circuits and the use of the signal generation devices found in an electronics laboratory.

       The platform consists of **the following elements**:

      \- Power supply module, with two switched-mode power supplies and numerous linear regulators, **connected to the power supply.** 


      \- A microcontroller, with two analogue input channels and an analogue output channel, with connection to the computer and the power supply module.


      \- A memory connected to the **microcontroller.** 


      \- A **signal generation** module connected to the analogue output channel of the microcontroller and to the user module.


      \- A signal capturing **module connected** to the two analogue input channels of the microcontroller and to the user module. 


      \- A user module with a breadboard to allow the user to assemble electronic circuits with connections to the signal capturing module, the signal generation module and the power supply module. This system is a step forward in electronic circuit assembly and measuring systems for academic use.

    descripcio: >-
      Lab@Home **is hardware that integrates** the basic elements of an
      electronics laboratory on a single, small-scale, low-cost board: 


      \- protoboard upon **which to assemble the circuits** 


      \- power sources 


      \- **measuring devices** (function generator and digital oscilloscope) 


      \- manually variable **switching and behaviour components** (switch, push-button and multiturn potentiometer) 


      Moreover, the **computer software control** of the functionalities of the measuring devices included on the board is independent of the programming language or software platform to be used.
aplicacions:
  - titol: L@b Home_applications
    descripcio: >-
      This device is a portable, **low-cost analogue electronics** laboratory. 


      It can therefore be applied to the online learning of the basic electronics competencies (design and assembly of electronic circuits, and **the use of laboratory signal** generation and measuring devices) normally acquired in classroom-based teaching. 


      **Thanks to its autonomy** it can also be used in the classroom to optimize laboratory practicals, as it enables teaching to be adapted to the various paces at which students learn.
