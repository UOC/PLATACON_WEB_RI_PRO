      Priority date: 23/04/12




      <!--StartFragment-->


      This innovation refers to an assembly and measurement system and has applications in the circuit electronics technical sector. An example of its application are electronic circuits, which are assembled in teaching laboratories to study different devices and assemblies.\

      More specifically, the system is a hardware platform that, when connected to a PC, offers the functions of a traditional electronics laboratory at a low cost: circuit assembly, testing, use of signal measurement or acquisition procedures, etc.\

      This platform presents the following elements:


      * power module, with two switched sources and a multiplicity of linear regulators, connected to the feeder;

      * a micro-controller, with two analogue input channels and one analogue output channel, with connection to the computer and the power module;

      * a memory connected to the micro-controller;

      * a signal generation module connected to the analogue output channel of the micro-controller and to the user module;

      * a signal capture module connected to the two analogue input channels of the micro-controller and to the user module;

      * a user module with an insertion circuit board that allows the user to assemble electronic circuits and with connections to the signal capture module, the signal generation module and the power module.


      This system constitutes an advance in electronic circuit assembly and measurement systems for the academic sphere. The advantages offered by this equipment are:


      1. It satisfactorily solves the existing problem relating to the compulsory nature of combining external elements for measurements or other functions.

      2. Reduced cost: existing equipment today has a cost that prohibits its use in educational institutions.

      3. It avoids the restrictions posed by the compulsory nature of proprietary software.

      4. It allows student mobility due to its small size.

      The utility model consists of a low-cost portable analogue electronics laboratory. It can, then, be applied to the online learning of the basic electronics skills (design and assembly of electronic circuits and the use of the signal generation apparatus of an electronics laboratory) that are acquired in on-site education. In addition, its autonomy enables on-site teaching to optimize laboratory practice time, which means it can be tailored to students' different learning paces.
