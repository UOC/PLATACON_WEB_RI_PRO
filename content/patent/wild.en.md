      Water tests are carried out during **the vehicle assembly process** to test watertightness and detect possible entries of water into the vehicle caused by holes or scratched or poorly attached parts. 


      The detection process is carried out manually by production line operators using moisture sensors. This detection process takes 2 to 3 minutes and generates a significant bottleneck in the automated production line.

       WILD proposes **new passive moisture** sensors that are capable of automatically detecting water leakages in a vehicle. 

      The sensors used for this detection, which are low-cost (< €0.15), wireless, battery-free and based on commercial UHF RFID tags, **are previously installed either by the suppliers** or during the manufacturing process. 


      Once **the vehicle has undergone** the water test, information is obtained from the sensors via RFID readers to determine whether there is a water leakage. If the system detects moisture levels corresponding to leakage, it automatically locates its position and informs the operator without the need for any direct intervention.

      WILD offers the **following advantages:** 


      \- Ultra **low-cost solution:** €0.10 per measuring point. 


      \- Shortening of tests by **taking multiple readings** in just a few seconds, reducing manufacturing times. 


      \- Significant **increase in test efficiency** with the elimination of errors caused by human intervention. 


      \- Increase in production quality**, avoiding the arrival** to the market of products with water leakage issues. 


      \- **Improvement of employee** safety by reducing exposure to harsh working environments. 


      \- Resource savings (e.g. water and electricity) per **production unit.**
