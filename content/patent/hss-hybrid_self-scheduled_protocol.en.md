       HSS **consists of a media access control** (MAC) protocol that takes advantage of the benefits of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and of radio-frequency identification (RFID) with a deterministic access of the TDMA (time-division multiple access) type with distributed queuing (DQ) and channel hopping (CH). 

      **HSS technology improves on the media access management** available with current protocols. Specifically, the communication system is based on time intervals with the incorporation of two queues for packet management: one for data transmission and the other to avoid collisions.


      **These queues are virtual and distributed** among all the nodes that form the network, that is, each node of the network knows the current size of the queues and its relative position in each one of them. 


      Accordingly, **in addition to the typical data transmission queue,** the nodes use the second queue to solve collision problems: 


      **the nodes are ordered such that in the next time interval** they will only solve the collisions of the first node in the queue, substantially reducing the number of collisions and, therefore, improving the efficiency of the system.

       **Moreover, the fact that the queues are distributed** allows for node mobility without having to support the additional costs of creating and distributing the planning of communications every time there is a change in the configuration of the network. 

      **This technology can also be combined with a channel** hopping mechanism to improve the robustness of the network in relation to the negative effects of multipath propagation and interferences, further improving energy efficiency.

  - descripcio: >-
      HSS offers **the following advantages:** 


      \- Increases network **efficiency by up to 99%** due to the elimination of data packet collisions by distributing nodes in a double queueing system 


      \- **Saves on infrastructure in dynamic** node networks as no planning mechanism is needed 


      \- Network **efficiency does not depend** on the number of nodes in the network


      \- Reduces **energy consumption compared** to current random network MAC protocols 


      \- **Counteracts the effects of multipath** propagation and neighbouring networks' interference thanks to its frequency hopping mechanism

      HSS is a technology that benefits telecommunications companies in general, but particularly those devoted to the design of integrated circuits (ASIC) and wireless communication protocols. HSS is a reliable alternative to be used in low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), which enable the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).

      Any wireless network, especially those with a dynamic number of nodes that generate bursty traffic. The final applications are: 


      * Management of smart cities (measurement and control of public services such as water, electricity, gas, etc.; public safety; environment; urban transport) Logistics and transport (fleet management, smart traffic management) 

      * Industry (process, supply chain and equipment monitoring) 

      * Agriculture (pest management, intelligent irrigation) 

      * E-health (telecare, remote patient monitoring, etc.)
