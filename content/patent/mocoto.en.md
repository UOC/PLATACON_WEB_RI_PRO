      MoCoTo is a **mobile corneal surface detection system**.


      It is based on an add-on for smartphones and tablets that acts as a camera lens. The add-on projects **specific lighting onto the eye surface** and the MoCoTo mobile app takes a photograph of it.


      Based on this photograph, the MoCoTo app generates the information necessary to create corneal elevation maps **using integrated calculation algorithms.** These maps form the patient's corneal topography, making it possible to assess their visual health.


      The MoCoTo app also stores the data in the patient's clinical history registered in the database server of the clinic/optician's shop. **This allows the eyesight professional** to access the patient's data and quickly and easily update them.

aspectes_innovadors:
  - descripcio: >-
      \- It increases **accessibility to corneal topographies**, allowing them
      to form part of the usual set of visual health tests. 


      \- The system is portable in comparison to the corneal topography equipment available on the market. - Major **reduction in the manufacturing costs associated** with this type of equipment. 


      \- Reduction of the unit cost of performing the test, around €200, in comparison to the cost of current corneal topographies, **which is in excess of €3,000.** 


      \- New corneal surface calculation method and new eye lighting system that improves camera-eye alignment, **reducing the time it takes to calculate** the results and facilitating resolution changes in the test.
