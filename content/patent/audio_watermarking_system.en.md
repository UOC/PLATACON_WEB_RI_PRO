      **Patent nº. PCT/EP2013/074971**  


      **Patent nº. US 15/039,666** 


      **Patent nº. EP13799269**


      Priority date: 28/11/13


      An audio watermark is a sequence of bits embedded in a streamed audio signal (TV, radio or internet). They are imperceptible to the human senses and are only picked up by devices such as smartphones or tablets. A watermark contains unique identifiers of both the portion of the audio from which the mark was extracted and the distribution source to which the content can be credited.


      We have come up with a solution with **two innovative aspects**: first, the use of the Fourier domain, and second, the use of the time and frequency domains during the embedding.


      Our system has the following **advantages**:


      1. Real-time recovery of embedded watermarks even at distances over 6 metres from the audio transmitter (other state-of-the-art applications can only recover at distances up to 1.5 metres).

      2. High fidelity and robust recovery even under very difficult conditions, overcoming broadcasting distortions and background noise.

      3. Better time synchronization between emitter and receiver, so the hidden content reaches its target at the right time.

      4. High capacity (over 1000 bits per second).

      5. No internet access needed for users to run the system.
