      Audio Watermarking technology c**onsists of a system for the embedding** and subsequent extraction of audio watermarks in real time for portable devices (smartphone, tablet or computer).

       A watermark contains **unique identifiers of both the portion** of the audio part from which the mark was extracted and the distribution source to which the content can be credited. 

      The technology makes it possible to hide information that is imperceptible to the human ear in audio signals. This information **can be extracted with a smartphone** or tablet. 


      The system developed includes two parts: the watermark embedding system implemented in a standard computer and a **watermark extraction system** in mobile devices and tablets.

    descripcio: >-
      What **sets Audio Watermarking** aside from other systems is that its
      embedding is done in the frequency domain (Fourier). 


      Moreover, a resynchronization mark is periodically inserted into the frequency domain.

       The **third element that the technology incorporates** is a time synchronization signal. Its advantages are as follows: 

      \- **Real-time recovery of embedded watermarks** even at distances over six metres from the audio transmitter (other latest-generation apps can only recover up to a distance of 1.5 metres).


      \- **High fidelity and effective recovery** even in adverse conditions, overcoming transmission distortions and background noise. - Better time synchronization between emitter and receiver, in such a way that the hidden content reaches the target at the right time


      . - **High capacity** (over 1000 bits per second).


      \- No internet **access needed** for users to run the system.
aplicacions:
  - titol: Audio watermarking_applications
    descripcio: >-
      Audio Watermarking can have numerous applications, such as marking the
      authorship of digital content or the inclusion of advertising in the audio
      signal. 


      **Specifically:**

       Media analytics: 

      \- Audience **measurements and broadcasting** monitoring 


      \- Campaign effectiveness measurement


      \- **Consumer analytics** on broadcasting, video on demand and even internet distribution Digital security: 


      \- Digital rights **management for video** on demand and music


      \- Another layer of security to detect counterfeiting and piracy 


      \- Authentication and **confirmation of genuine** content Multimedia advertising:


      \- **Connection of television** broadcasts with mobile apps to increase viewer engagement


      \- Synchronization with advertising **in real time on second screens** when a programme or advertisement is on air
