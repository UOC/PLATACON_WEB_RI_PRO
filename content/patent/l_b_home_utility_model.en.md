      Spanish utility model no: U201230432. Priority date: 20 April 2012.
      Lab@Home is a platform developed for teaching basic analogue electronics
      skills online. 


      This tool enables the student to learn how to design and assemble electronic circuits in a practical way. With this tool, the student will also learn to use the typical signal generation devices found in an electronics laboratory, which they can use to power circuits and take measurements with a multimeter and an oscilloscope, among other devices.


      The platform consists of an electronic instrumentation board with connectivity to a PC, and associated software which controls the board, creating a unique tool for autonomous learning.


      This system is a breakthrough in assembly and measurement systems for electronic circuits for the academic field.

    descripcio: >-
      Lab@Home is hardware that includes the basic items of an electronics
      laboratory in a single small and low-cost board:


      * A protoboard on which to mount circuits.

      * Power sources.

      * Measuring devices (function generator and digital oscilloscope).

      * Manually variable switching and performance components (switch, push-button and multi-turn potentiometer).


      Control using computer software of the functions of the measuring devices included in the board is also not dependent on the programming language or software platform used.

      Lab@Home is a low-cost, portable analogue electronics lab. It can be
      applied to learning about basic practical electronics content online
      (design and assembly of electronic circuits, and using signal generation
      and measurement devices found in the laboratory), and in face-to-face
      training, as it enhances autonomy and optimizes practical time in the
      laboratory, enabling teaching to be adapted to students' different
      learning speeds.


      Another innovative feature is that it contains a wide range of items, processes and functionalities found in a traditional electronics laboratory on a single platform.
