      This video **watermarking technology** consists of a robust, imperceptible digital watermarking system that can be used to protect digital media against piracy and tampering. In contrast to many other methods, it survives the latest H.264 digital compression technology. 


      The strength of this technology is its capacity to work with H.264 **video compression technologies,** including high-definition audio and video on Blu-ray Discs, internet streaming sources (Vimeo, YouTube, iTunes), website software (Flash Player, Sliverlight), broadcast services, videoconferencing and security systems. 


      **The watermark is practically imperceptible** and can be reliably removed (even with a significant loss in signal), while incorporating a high degree of information.

       The proposed **technology increases transparency,** robustness and capacity, which are normally subject to a trade-off when selecting watermark technology. The technology is now being developed as a semi-fragile watermarking system to authenticate video and detect tempering. 

      In these applications, the **attacker aims** to alter the medium without the change being detectable. A fragile (or semi-fragile) watermark makes it possible for the attacker to alter the video content without detecting it. 


      Therefore, this technology enables the detection of tampering and even its **location at specific** parts of the video. 


      The system is also capable of withstanding **a certain level of compression** while maintaining the watermark embedded.

    descripcio: >-
      Video Watermarking **offers an innovative approach** to combat tampering
      and counterfeiting and provides a good trade-off between capacity,
      transparency and bit rate, with multiple advantages: 


      \- **Total reversibility,** since the original content can easily be restored.


      \- Zero distortion of the **multimedia content** 


      \- **More robustness**, as the hidden stream is encrypted using several keys 


      \- Real-time extraction processes, since only decoding procedures are required but not total **decompression of the video** 


      \- Minimum **alteration of the bit** rate 


      \- Greater reliability, since the risk of **losing the watermark** due to compression is avoided
