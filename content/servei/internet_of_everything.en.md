      Description


      We develop tailor-made tools and solutions for smart wireless connection for machines and people, helping improve and increase the flexibility of production in Industry 4.0 and the digitization of services. We are experts in:


      * Developing communication technologies for connected devices in cities (smart cities), in roads and large infrastructures, in industry, in home networks and in communication networks, among others.

      * Integrating cyber-physical systems in the cloud and over the entire industrial chain: design, manufacture, distribution and use.

      * Developing dynamic data models and contextual intelligence systems for automation, flexibility and control of industrial and logistics processes in real time.

      * Developing tailor-made geolocation systems via satellite IoT communication.

      * Creating secure and efficient distributed networks capable of combining different technologies.

      * Assessing the use and management of resources (devices and energy) in a dynamic manner to ensure their efficient use.


      #### Our services


      * Automation of industrial processes. Smart solutions for the optimization of production lines and to improve the maintenance of equipment.

      * Secure and efficient communication protocols for wireless networks. Development of wireless connection systems as they gradually provide an efficient response to the challenges of flexible and distributed logistics and manufacturing, while ensuring data protection and the protection of industrial property. 

      * Local and global positioning systems. Tailor-made developments using radio and/or satellite communication technologies that make it possible to connect industrial equipment and assets both locally and globally.

      * Smart integration of technological applications and systems in Industry 4.0. Tailor-made technological developments to integrate industrial digital platforms and equipment that use heterogeneous technologies.

      * Optimization of resource use and management. Dynamic systems for the analysis of distributed data that make it possible to measure the use of resources in real time and specify interventions in order to get the best performance out of them, carry out predictive maintenance and/or reduce their energy consumption.


      #### Our value


      1. #### We have developed predictive maintenance systems for the industrial cooling sector.




      2. We have created SmartClocks, an energy-efficient communication protocol that makes it possible to automatically synchronize devices on IoT networks without the need for external time sources (GPS) or dedicated communications. 




      3. We have developed the WILD technology, which automatically detects moisture and liquid leakage in, for example, production lines, warehouses and construction sites, thanks to a low-cost wireless technology that works without batteries. 




      4. We have worked together with industry in the development of open platforms to enable the automation of industrial processes. 




      5. The Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) has been our R&I reference centre since the year 2000. Its aim is to develop digital-age technological solutions and to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity. 




      #### Who is it aimed at?


      * #### Industries in any sector with automated and/or distributed design, manufacturing and digital logistics processes.


      **Public administrations and other public service organizations that promote or carry out digital smart city interventions.**
