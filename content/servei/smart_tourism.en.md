      **Description:**


      At the UOC we **believe that tourism and leisure** are agents of change that can improve the competitiveness and sustainability of your tourism project:


      * We **can provide support in the transformation** of your tourism and/or cultural project with an experimental approach based on social impact and benefits, taking both current and future perspectives into account.

      * We can help you **plan new cultural** and tourism projects and programmes based on an innovative approach.

      * We can provide advice regarding **the use of ICT** as a tool for the creation, production, management, dissemination and consumption of culture and tourism. 


      **Our services**


      * Creation of **new sustainable and inclusive models**. Support to improve the tourist attractions on offer and the tourist experience through projects that foster sustainability, social inclusion and cooperation between the players involved.

      * Development of **places for tourism and leisure.** Establishment of strategic and innovative plans for the development of tourism and leisure by means of dynamic and experimental studies that combine theoretical aspects of social sciences with empirical studies. 

      * Analysis of the **relationship between culture and tourism.** Assessment of the impacts of cultural events and strategic proposals to transform them on the basis of sustainability and inclusion.

      * Use of local currencies. **Feasibility analysis**, and design and implementation of local currencies for the social and financial revitalization of tourist towns and cities.

      * **Digital implementations:**

      * **Digitization and platformization of tourism.** Research, consultancy and training in relation to digitization and platformization processes for tourism and leisure.

      * Development of **ICT infrastructures for data cybersecurity.** These technologies are key tools for enabling new digital services for the tourism industry. 

      * **Immersive experiences.** Design and creation of tourism (and educational) experiences using virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality, with and without geolocation.

      * Local and global positioning systems. **Tailor-made developments** using radio and satellite communication technologies that make it possible to connect assets and equipment both locally and globally.

      * **Language processing** and automatic translation assistance technologies.

      **Our value**


      1. We have the [NOUTUR](https://noutur.uoc.edu/) group, a **multidisciplinary team** of experts that focuses on innovation in the tourism and leisure industry on the basis of two driving forces: the impact of ICT on the consumption of tourism, and sustainability.




      2. [Immersium Studio](https://immersiumstudio.com/?lang=en) is **one of our best-known spin-offs**. It has worked with museums, real estate agents, town councils, universities and foundations. The company, which works in the fields of tourism, culture and education, creates virtual and augmented reality experiences which enable users to become immersed in a different context and experience the sensations of role-playing. 




      3. [The Internet Interdisciplinary Institute](https://research.uoc.edu/portal/en/in3/index.html) (IN3) **has been our R&I reference** centre since the year 2000. Its aim is to develop digital-age technological solutions and to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity. 




      **Who is it aimed at?**


      * **Public administrations**, tourism management and promotion bodies and agencies, associations and foundations.

      * **Tour operators, travel agents**, hotel chains and other accommodation services, leisure parks, museums, etc.
