      **Our value**


      1. We have a critical mass of expert researchers specializing in: (a) relevant social challenges of the network society (such as connections between ICT and politics, demography and ageing); (b) socio-environmental and technological urban transformations; (c) relationships between gender and science and ICT; and (d) the impact of the digital revolution on institutions and citizen empowerment.

      2. The Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) has been our R&I reference centre since the year 2000, and its aim is to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity. 

      3. The "Gender and ICT" programme, which was created by the IN3 in November 2006, examines the reasons for women's low participation rates in various areas of information and communication technologies (ICT)—in the fields of education, research and employment—as well as the injustices that arise as a result. "Gender and ICT" is currently an internationally renowned and prestigious consolidated research group. 




      **Who is it aimed at?**


      * Organizations wishing to reduce inequalities in the social, professional and digital environments.

      * Organizations that promote citizen participation through technology and networks.

      * Public administrations and public bodies.
