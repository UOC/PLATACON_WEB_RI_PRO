      **Description**


      We are at your disposal to maximize social change through language and culture as agents of transformation. **More specifically, we can provide:**


      * Action models and analyses based on literature and culture in order to resolve situations of exclusion, inequality and discrimination.

      * Advice on the relationships between language, identity and social inequality, and their implications.

      * Strategies for social and economic adaptation to foreign cultures.

      * Technological tools linked to automatic language processing.

      * Studies on the use of public spaces to enable well-being.


      **Our services**


      * **Consultancies and the social uses of literature.** We focus on social groups at risk of exclusion, such as immigrants, refugees, victims of conflict and people suffering from psychological disorders. We use literature to uncover prejudice and gender roles and highlight the situation of women, and we provide advice on using literary references applicable to the psychological treatment of victims of gender violence and sufferers of illnesses and disorders.

      * **Advice on language and identity.** We study the relationships, and their implications, between language, identity and social inequality, and personal and emotional investment when using languages in multilingual contexts. We apply knowledge about history to make public policy, and we place our qualitative and quantitative sociolinguistic knowledge at the service of designing projects for the study of language.




      * **Language-related technologies and applications.** These tools envisage: (1) discourse analysis, (2) terminology extraction, and (3) translation support through natural language processing and the customization of neural machine translation systems.




      * **Advice on East Asian markets and cultures.** We provide advice on culture, language, the economy, international trade and tourism in China and the rest of East Asia. 




      * **Studies about the use of public spaces**. We help design public policies on the use of public spaces, and we assess and measure the social impact of such uses.


      **Our value**


      1. The **humanities at the UOC enable a global** and critical understanding of social reality by means of an integrated and complementary view of various disciplines (language, history, philosophy, literature...). The capacity for analysis resulting from their interdisciplinary nature makes it easier to understand contemporary culture and society, an understanding that we place at the disposal of the organizations with which we work.




      1. We have an **interdisciplinary team** with an innovative and forward-looking vision of the relationship between information and communication technology (ICT) and language, culture and literature expertise.




      1. Our doctoral **programme in Humanities and Communication** aims to increase our knowledge of social change phenomena from an interdisciplinary and international point of view.



         **Who is it aimed at?**

         * **Public administrations** and public bodies.
         * Organizations working on minimizing social inequalities and the promotion of integration.
         * Brands wishing to enter **Asian markets.**
         * Technology companies with an interest in, among other things, language tools, natural language processing or the relationship between ICT and language and culture.
