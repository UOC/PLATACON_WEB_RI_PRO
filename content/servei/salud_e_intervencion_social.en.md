      **Health and Social Intervention**


      The health and improved **quality of life of people** suffering from illness is a complex social challenge that we must approach from an open perspective with expert knowledge and all the tools at our disposal. 


      The UOC has research and innovation-based solutions whose ultimate aim is to make a positive impact on the health and quality of life of every member of the public in fields such as nutrition and eating disorders, psychology and cognitive neuroscience, speech therapy and language disorders, and the management of critical situations, among others. We also offer services relating to socio-educational action and the professional practice of social education.


      **Our services**


      * Nutrition and eating disorders. We **provide advice** on the definition of healthy eating and physical activity programmes, using e-health and ICT, particularly for the purpose of addressing chronic disease such as overweight. We also analyse the evolution of eating patterns and behaviours from a sociocultural point of view.

      * Cognitive neuroscience. We provide advice and methodological support in the design of clinical neuropsychological interventions using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. 

      * **Speech and language** therapy and language disorders. We provide advice on the practical application of scientific evidence in intervention and early detection models in the field of speech therapy and language recovery stimulation in children with SLI.

      * **Critical situation** management. We provide advice on experiences and emotional management of grief, as well as analysing the impact of new technologies in this area.

      * **Inclusive care networks**. We develop inclusive participation methods for the design of care policies, services and technologies. We also conduct studies on new forms of group action and social support in the fields of ageing, disability and chronic illness.

      * **Legal psychology.** We provide prevention and intervention advice and training on fields linked to legal psychology for both private and public enterprises.

      * **Social intervention.** We design socio-educational action models and provide advice and consultancy services for professional development in social education.
