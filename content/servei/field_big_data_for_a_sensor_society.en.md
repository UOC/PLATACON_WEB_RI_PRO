      **Description** 


      We design and develop software and data platforms for the dynamic and transparent analysis of large amounts of data to optimize processes and improve decision-making in connected and sensor societies. These solutions make it possible to:


      * Integrate large amounts of data from the environment collected by sensors and a variety of devices using mobile phones, drones with cameras, etc.

      * Create tailor-made data platforms for the optimization of processes by incorporating business intelligence models for decision-making and MapReduce technologies for parallel and distributed processing of data.

      * Develop tailor-made models and studies for smart city applications and/or applications that integrate user perception and use.

      * Develop tailor-made smart systems and software to facilitate decision-making.

      * Focus them on medicine, designing bioinformatics applications to process medical and clinical data, such as, among other uses, medical imaging for the design of biomarkers.

      **Our services**


      * **New data models and big data platforms**. Integration of large-scale data and heterogeneous technologies (e.g. mobile phones, drones, environmental sensors) to facilitate the efficient extraction of knowledge from processes. These big data platforms include business intelligence models that connect data to decision-making and MapReduce technologies, achieving the parallel and distributed processing of data. 

      * **Smart software.** Development and optimization of software for the dynamic and/or smart analysis of large amounts of data to optimize logistics, production and social and industrial economic performance.

      * **Big data applications for smart cities.** Theoretical and applied urban studies based on analysing large amounts of data from environmental variables that make it possible to model scenarios and/or produce predictive tools. These solutions address urban contexts such as, among others, traffic dynamics, the management of public spaces and the environment.

      * **Social applications of big data.** Analysing large volumes of data by means of computational social science tools that make it possible to model production and consumption scenarios to optimize the production and sale of products and services.

      **Our value**


      1. We have developed predictive and contextual intelligence systems in fields such as the food industry, improving supply and distribution chains.

      2. We have developed an application that uses data from urban traffic accidents to predict the likelihood of accidents between vehicles and pedestrians and match them to locations on city maps.

      3. We have worked together with industry in the development of open platforms to enable the automation of industrial and logistics processes. 

      4. The Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) has been our R&I reference centre since the year 2000. Its aim is to develop digital-age technological solutions and to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity.

      **Who is it aimed at?**


      * Businesses and industries in any sector with automated and/or distributed design, manufacturing and digital logistics processes seeking big data solutions.

      * Public administrations and other public service organizations that promote or carry out digital smart city operations.
