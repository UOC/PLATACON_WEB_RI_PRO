      **Description:**


      Socioeconomic changes are a constant challenge for our healthcare system: increased demand for healthcare, an ageing population, more mobile citizens, the need to manage large amounts of information, global competitiveness, and an interest in constantly improving healthcare.


      At the UOC we can introduce innovation and a smart use of ICT to successfully face these challenges, providing the appropriate context to create and share resources whenever and wherever this is necessary, providing the chance to work collaboratively as part of a network, share and disseminate best practices, create knowledge through members' actions and reactions, and introduce telemedicine in health organizations.


      **Our services**


      * **E-health tools** for management and logistics. We design and assess e-health decision-assistance tools for professionals, patients and the general public. We also work on defining and assessing new healthcare provision models, particularly comprehensive care models with ICT. 

      * **Telecare, telemedicine and medical devices**. Advice for the development, implementation and assessment of technological and social innovations for elderly, disabled or chronically ill people, and development and assessment of innovations in health and care (telemedicine, e-health, robotics, AI). 

      * **Bioinformatics.** Use of big data and data analytics in the field of health and bioinformatics. We work on the design of medical imaging-based biomarkers, and we use artificial intelligence applied to medicine.

      * **Digital skill building for health professionals.** Teaching and learning processes in virtual environments in healthcare in order to acquire advanced minimally invasive surgery skills.

      * **Ageing and digital technologies**. We assess the impact of using ICT on the healthcare system and active ageing, getting all actors in the healthcare system involved.

      * **The impact of e-health.** Design and assessment of technological applications and campaigns in the field of health aimed at generating change and the transformation of behaviour.


      **Our value**


      1. The UOC brings the experience of specialist professionals, **tools and applications** based on information and communication technologies (ICTs) to the social and healthcare system to improve people's quality of life and facilitate the medical and scientific community's work.

      2. We have **research groups and the eHealth Center,** an academic centre open to the world whose aim is to educate and train both ordinary citizens and professionals through technology in order to lead the paradigm shift in health. People-centred and using research, education and guidance to contribute to society's progress and well-being.

      3. The [Internet Interdisciplinary Institute](https://research.uoc.edu/portal/en/in3/index.html) (IN3) **has been our R&I reference** centre since the year 2000. Its aim is to develop digital-age technological solutions and to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity. 


      **Who is it aimed at?**


      * Companies, institutions and centres at every **stage of the social** and healthcare value chain.

      * The general public and people suffering from a variety of diseases or wishing to improve their well-being.
