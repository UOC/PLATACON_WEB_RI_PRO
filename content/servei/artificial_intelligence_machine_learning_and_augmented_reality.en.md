      **Description**


      We provide support for the digital transformation of your company (both in terms of organization and with regard to the products or services you provide), providing advice and developing smart tools and solutions that enable you to: 


      * Automatically analyse images to identify facial expressions, specific characteristics of the urban environment or clinical images for the design of biomarkers.

      * Use deep learning to automate quality control processes or for large-scale and/or high-precision industrial classification.

      * Improve human-machine interfaces.

      * Use artificial intelligence to improve user, customer or patient screening.

      * Develop artificial intelligence and machine learning applications to carry out digital marketing strategies.




      **Our services**


      * **Artificial intelligence** and machine learning.

      * * Facial recognition systems and other applications to improve user interfaces and new digital marketing tools. 
        * Deep learning applications for the development of improvements to industrial processes.
        * Analysis of geolocated images relating to uses of public spaces with applications to optimize urban services and/or carry out interventions for road safety and public well-being.
        * Analysis of images to design biomarkers for patient screening.



      * **Augmented reality.** 

      * * Developments of hybrid systems—physical reality + virtual reality—to improve industrial processes such as manufacturing, assistance and maintenance, logistics and occupational safety. 
        * Augmented reality solutions for advanced marketing applications. 

      **Our value**


      1. We have developed bacteria classification systems based on automatic image analysis and machine learning.

      2. We have worked together with industry to develop brain biomarkers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      3. We have developed predictive and contextual intelligence systems in areas such as the food industry, improving supply and distribution chains.




      4. The Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) has been our R&I reference centre since the year 2000. Its aim is to develop digital-age technological solutions and to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity. 




      **Who is it aimed at?**


      * Industries in **any sector wishing** to get the most out of data and new technologies to put smarter and more efficient processes and services in place.

      * Public administrations and **other public service** organizations that promote or carry out digital smart city interventions.

      * Digital marketing companies working in different sectors of **Industry 4.0.**
