      **Description**


      We design and develop tailor-made solutions for the optimization of highly complex industrial processes and systems, such as precision or high-tech manufacturing, maintenance of state-of-the-art technological infrastructure and equipment, and after-sales service.


      **Our services** and solutions enable you to: 


      * Create tailor-made data architectures and complex distributed computing systems with open source code and data processing technologies, which can be cloud and multiformat solutions.

      * Improve and optimize manufacturing and quality control processes by applying complex modelling systems to engineering.

      * Develop tailor-made and automated communication interfaces for equipment maintenance and/or personalized customer service. 


      **Our services**


      * Advanced data architecture and **analytical models**. Designing distributed and high-performance computing systems. Systems for the automatic translation of data into different formats (e.g. XML, CSV, API). New data analysis software models designed to optimize industrial processes.




      * Complex systems modelling in engineering. **Artificial intelligence, machine learning** and big data technologies applied to modelling in engineering applied to industrial production design and optimization.




      * **Creation of chatbots and open data.** Advice on, and development of, tailor-made chatbots capable of being integrated into different platforms and accessed by text and voice, to improve the maintenance of equipment and applications, customer attraction and after-sales service, among others. **Advice and development** of solutions to make data published by companies and public administrations as open data accessible, intelligible and profitable.


      #### Our value.


      1. #### We have developed contextual and predictive intelligence systems for, among other things, patient screening and improved management of emergency medical services.

      2. We have worked together with industry in the development of open platforms to enable the automation of industrial and logistics processes. 

      3. The Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) has been our R&I reference centre since the year 2000. Its aim is to **develop digital-age technological** solutions and to study the internet and the effects of the interaction between digital technologies and human activity. 




      #### Who is it aimed at?


      * #### Industries in any sector with complex automated or distributed design, manufacturing and digital logistics processes.

      * Companies and organizations in sectors with complex, multivariable challenges, such as the fields of health, social crisis response, and natural space and resource management.

      * Public administrations and **other public service organizations** that promote or carry out digital smart city interventions and digital services for the public.
