      **Description**


      We develop and implement solutions to digitize your company or service with the security and privacy of your and your customers' data as our main priority. In order to do this, we create advanced encryption and blockchain technology solutions. Our aim is:


      * To process and collect data securely and privately over the entire production and service chain.

      * To design protocols and processes that are ethical and intelligent and observe the privacy of data in order to optimize time and resources in your organization's digital management.

      * To develop tailor-made systems and services to anticipate and address threats in electronic communications and public digital information systems.


      **Our services**


      * **Cybersecurity.** Prevention, detection, investigation and creation of tools in response to incidents or threats on electronic communication networks and public information systems.

      * **User privacy and content protection**. Watermarking and encryption systems for the secure storage and transmission of multimedia information and data.

      * **Network privacy and security.** Development of tailor-made solutions based on network type (e.g. peer-to-peer, ad hoc, sensors and RFID, online social or vehicular networks, IoT, etc.).


      **Our value**


      1. As experts in cybercrime, we collaborate with local police forces (EUROPOL) in this field.

      2. We are joint leaders of local and European cryptography networks.

      3. We have developed our own multimedia information watermarking system against piracy that is robust and imperceptible and does not affect data transfers.
