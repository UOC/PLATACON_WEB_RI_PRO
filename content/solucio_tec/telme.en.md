about:
  - descripcio: >-
      Specific language impairment (SLI) affects **the acquisition of oral
      language** without any accompanying cognitive, anatomical, neurological or
      social deficits. 7% of children are affected by SLI and 60-80% of children
      with a history of SLI experience reading difficulties and low academic
      progress in preadolescence. 


      It is, therefore, a disorder that is **very closely associated** with school failure. 


      Telme is an app for mobile devices that is designed to improve the articulation, pronunciation and learning of Spanish words by children with **speaking and language problems.** 


      Its autonomous educational approach enables efficient improvement and recovery in cases of **specific language** impairment. 


      The app is the result of the RecerTEL project led by the Cognition and Language Research Group (GRECIL), which offers specialist services and aims to provide **tools and resources** to families and professionals related to language acquisition disorders, specifically those affected by SLI.

aspectes_innovadors:
  - descripcio: >-
      Telme uses a learning procedure **based on the repetition**, imitation,
      modelling and self-modelling methodology.

       The selection and presentation of the words and the app's activities and tasks are based on scientific research conducted in the area of language acquisition on children with and without difficulties. Its main advantages are as **follows:** 

      \- The application of experimental and descriptive techniques that focus on the phonological, grammatical and conceptual **aspects of words**. 


      \- The sequencing and design of exercises based on cognitive processes involved in the acquisition and **articulation of language**.

aplicacions:
  - descripcio: >-
      The first of the app's two modes **is aimed at speech therapists** and/or
      psychologists who want to apply this training to children with language
      difficulties. It allows them to select a specific phoneme to be worked on
      with exercises based on words that contain it. 


      The second mode provides **children with language difficulties** (with or without adult supervision) with a more autonomous and fun way of training. 


      The child sees a mouth correctly pronouncing the word over their own face, improving their understanding of how the word should be pronounced. This fun approach allows children to practice the various phonemes and **learn new words**.

       The Telme app is aimed at three types of users: those directly or indirectly affected by the disorder (children and parents), **prescribers of services** (public bodies and education professionals), and **clinical professionals** (psychologists, doctors, speech therapists, etc.).
