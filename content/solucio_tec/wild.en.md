about:
  - descripcio: >-
      Water tests are carried out during **the vehicle assembly** process to
      test watertightness and detect possible entries of water into the vehicle
      caused by holes or scratched or poorly attached parts. 


      The detection process is carried out manually by production line operators using moisture sensors. This detection process takes 2 to 3 minutes and generates **a significant bottleneck** in the automated production line.

       WILD makes it possible to detect moisture and liquid leakage thanks to its wireless, low-cost and battery-free technology. 

      WILD proposes the use of new passive moisture sensors that are low-cost (< €0.15), wireless, battery-free and based on commercial UHF RFID tags, which are to be previously installed either by the suppliers or during **the manufacturing process**. 


      Once the vehicle has undergone the water test, information is obtained from the sensors via RFID readers to determine whether **there is a water leakage**. 


      If the system detects moisture levels corresponding to a leakage, it automatically locates its position and informs the operator without the **need for any direct intervention**. 


      The solution enables the automation of passive moisture detection tests with the goal of minimizing costs and the time taken by line operators to **carry out inspections**.

  - descripcio: >-
      WILD offers the **following advantages**:


      \- Ultra low-cost solution: €0.10 per measuring point. 


      \- **Shortening of tests** by taking multiple readings in just a few seconds, reducing manufacturing times.


      \- Significant increase in test efficiency with **the elimination of errors** caused by human intervention.


      \- Increase in production quality, avoiding the arrival to the market of **products with water** leakage issues.


      \- **Improvement of employee** safety by reducing exposure to harsh working environments. 


      \- Resource savings (e.g. water and electricity) per **production unit.**
