  slogan: Did you know you can create chatbots without knowing how to code?
about:
  - descripcio: >-
      Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are a **new trend designed** to
      facilitate the automation of company processes that normally require human
      interaction, such as verifications and approvals of internal tasks or
      supplier inquiries regarding previous statuses. 


      CUIs complement other "traditional" **interfaces such as forms on websites**, offering a more flexible and natural channel. Until now, CUIs had often been provided by actual humans, frequently as part of an outsourcing contract at a call centre outsourced or contracted by a customer service specialist. 


      Now, companies are increasingly replacing these centres with chatbots, which offer a quicker and more scalable response. However, the creation of a chatbot is prone to mistakes and requires a lot of time and advanced **skills in several fields** (e.g. software development and automatic learning). 


      Therefore, many companies opt for hiring a specialist to develop a tailor-made chatbot. This is expensive and negates some of the advantages of having a chatbot. 


      It also prevents small and **medium-sized enterprises** from creating their own chatbot even when they have all the data the chatbot needs to operate. 


      The Xatkit platform provides you with the flexibility to simply and easily create bots without any programming knowledge. This solution has been transferred to the **UOC spin-off of the same name.**
