about:
  - titol: HSS_description 
    descripcio: >-
      HSS is a low-power hybrid MAC **protocol that improves** on the management
      of media access of current protocols, given that it eliminates collisions
      in data transmissions by means of node distribution in a double queueing
      system. 


      This method of managing transmissions enables a significant increase in the performance of the network, regardless of its number of nodes, and a **reduction in energy** consumption.

    descripcio: >-
      HSS offers the **following advantages:** 


      \- Increases network efficiency by up to 99% due to the elimination of data packet collisions by distributing nodes in a double **queueing system**


      \- Saves on infrastructure in dynamic node networks as no planning **mechanism is needed** 


      \- Network efficiency does not depend on the number of nodes in the network 


      \- Reduces energy consumption compared to current random network **MAC protocols** 


      \- Counteracts the effects of multipath propagation and neighbouring networks' interference thanks to its frequency **hopping mechanism**
