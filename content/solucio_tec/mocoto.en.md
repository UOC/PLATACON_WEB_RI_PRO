  - descripcio: >-
      MOCOTO is a mobile system for the detection of the corneal surface that
      makes it possible to produce **corneal topographies** at low cost by means
      of a smartphone or tablet accessory in order to improve the adaptation of
      contact lenses to the eye. 


      It is composed of an accessory and an app that make it possible to study the shape of the cornea, an essential element to ensure that **contact lenses** are properly adapted. 


      It is based on an add-on that acts as the lens of a camera, projecting specific light onto the eye surface so the MoCoTo **app can take a photo** of it.

aspectes_innovadors:
  - descripcio: >-
      The main advantages are: 


      \- It increases accessibility to corneal topographies, allowing them to form part of the usual set of visual health tests. 


      \- The system is portable in comparison to the corneal topography equipment available in the market. - Major reduction in the manufacturing costs associated with this type of equipment.


      \- Reduction of the unit cost of performing the test, around €200, in comparison to the cost of current corneal topographies, which is in excess of €3,000. 


      \- New corneal surface calculation method and new eye lighting system that improves camera-eye alignment, reducing the time it takes to calculate the results and facilitating resolution changes in the test.
