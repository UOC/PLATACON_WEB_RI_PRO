      Augmented reality (AR) is the term used to define the direct or indirect viewing through a technology device (smartphone, tablet, etc.) of a physical environment of the real world, combined with virtual elements (video, audio, images, 3D animations, websites) for the creation of a mixed reality in real time.\

      Augmented reality is not a new technology but an emerging one. Advances in technology, the growing presence of telephones with an Internet connection and the new consumer culture are laying the basis for this technology, which offers endless possibilities.

      The use of augmented reality provides the following benefits:\

      • It increases the commitment and interaction with the user and provides a richer experience.\

      • It increases the users' perceived value of products and brands.\

      • It is a mobile and personal technology and is therefore highly accessible in a market with a high level of penetration of mobile devices.\

      • It is an economical communication alternative.\

      • It offers detailed analysis regarding the users/consumers.

      Augmented reality can be applied to all productive sectors. The experience of the UOC centres in the creation of AR experiences for the fields of education, culture, tourism and advertising. Some examples of applications in these fields are:\

      • Education:\

      o Contextualization and clarification of concepts in text books:\

      - Include videos or interactive 3D models that explain a concept clearly.\

      - Include interactive apps that help practise a subject and that can comprise or complement homework.\

      o Historical / cultural / social contextualization on school trips:\

      - Create educational routes enriched with digital content such as videos, 3D models, web pages, etc.\

      • Culture and advertising:\

      o Animate and advertise visits to museums, arts centres and exhibitions through image recognition, associating digital information with works of art, archaeological remains, paper catalogues, digital catalogues, programmes, advertisements, window displays, etc.\

      o Provide additional information about shows and events, offering information when passing in front of theatres, cinemas and premises or when pointing the mobile at a banner or advertising poster.\

      • Tourism:\

      o Enhance and advertise landscapes, cultural heritage, tourist trails or points of interest through geolocation, associating digital information with any set of geographical points or using image recognition.\

      o Turn tours into treasure hunts to foster the tourist completing the trail and visiting all the points of interest on the route.\

      o Time travel: to be able to see an area set in a specific era.\

      o Offer promotional discounts through image recognition.

      [\- **Augmented Reality experience on the skull of a Triceratops at the CosmoCaixa Museum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0QueSx6J0o&feature=emb_title)


      In this case, an augmented reality experience has been developed for viewing an animated 3D model of a Triceratops with photo-realistic quality based on recognition of the skull exhibited at CosmoCaixa, the Obra Social "la Caixa" Science Museum. To view this model, visitors use a smartphone or a tablet.


      The goal was to leverage the possibilities offered by current mobile technology to enrich the exhibition with educational content. Given the good results obtained with this project, CosmoCaixa has decided to continue working with the UOC to create new experiences with other items exhibited at the museum.


      [\- **The UOC's educational model with augmented reality:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V060nGTsq7s&feature=emb_title)

      The goal of this project was to innovate in the communication on "What it's like to study at the UOC", targeting future students in particular and, in general, anyone who contacts the UOC's centres, using augmented reality technology. This video shows a report on the UOC's educational model and augmented reality broadcast on EL 9 TV in December 2013.


      The UOC's centres are places that are often the future student's first contact with the UOC to find out how studying is done (educational model), what is studied (contents) and with what means (Virtual Campus and classrooms). Efficiently communicating these aspects to the visitor at the centre is one way of accurately showing what the UOC is and delping the future student in his or her decision to enrol, as well as representing the UOC's image in the territory. Given its function as a cradle for new technologies, any communication made by the UOC with respect to how, what and by what means must necessarily be innovative and attractive.

      **\- [Virtual property tours with Solvia:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJo5DTu4uKo&feature=emb_title)**


      The goal was to offer innovative solutions for promoting Solvia Inmobiliaria's housing stock. These solutions included a Kinect device for navigating with the human body inside a 3D model of a property, a virtual tour using a touch screen to view real 360º graphic material of a dwelling, and interactive print solutions using graphic resources and catalogues.


      Visitors to the stand ad BCN Meeting Point 2015 were able to benefit from improved views of the properties for sale using a variety of Augmented Reality techniques. Furthermore, the stand's visitors were offered the possibility of enjoying this experience with tablets provided to them or using their own personal mobile devices connected to the stand's Wi-Fi.
