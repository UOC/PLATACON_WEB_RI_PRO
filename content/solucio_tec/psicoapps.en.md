      intervention, a distraction intervention and a component to allow users to

  - descripcio: >-
      **Chronic pain is a problem suffered around the world**, affecting around
      25% of the European population with a high impact. Psychosocial programmes
      are the most effective method of managing pain problems. 


      Cognitive restructuring (replacing harmful thoughts with more positive ones) and distraction (reducing the intensity of sensations) are the most used and most efficient techniques. Unfortunately, access to these **psychosocial programmes** is difficult due to the lack of specialists, high costs, long distances to visit professionals and social stigma. 


      Psico Apps aim to provide a solution in this field through two mobile apps: 


      **PositiveThinkingApp**: based on cognitive restructuring, it helps identify negative thoughts to subsequently challenge them and reformulate them as positive thoughts through gamification. 


      **DistractApp**: it includes a set of resources (audio, video, texts, etc.) to help distract the patient and divert their attention away from their pain.

       The application suggests specific resources taking into account the selections and preferences of the users, also by means of gamification.
