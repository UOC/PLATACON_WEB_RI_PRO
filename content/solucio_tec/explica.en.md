      The objective of this app is **to facilitate the creation of explanatory
      videos** by drawing and writing on a digital blackboard. 


      The app records the images of the explanation developed on the blackboard (drawing/text) and records the accompanying **explanatory audio**, creating a video of the full explanation. The resulting video can be shared on social media, edited with any other app or even sent by email. 


      The video is made with a digital blackboard, **recording the drawing created** on it with the explanation voiced by the user. Documents can also be imported and then worked on in the same way, drawing on them and recording an explanation at the same time. 


      Explica! is available in iOS for Apple **devices and in Play Store for Android devices.**
