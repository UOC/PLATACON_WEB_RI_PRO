about:
  - descripcio: >-
      NMT focuses on the field of **machine translation**. Specifically, it
      applies, customizes and trains machine translation engines in accordance
      with the specified needs of the domain. 


      Additionally, independently of their knowledge of statistical tools, the team specializes in the use of new neural engines that **use deep learning**. 


      They offer greater efficiency and require less post-editing given that they are capable of adapting to the semantics of each scope (deep learning), which they learn for themselves, and offer extremely reliable and **high-quality results**.

aspectes_innovadors:
  - descripcio: >-
      The most innovative aspects are related to the research group's expertise
      in the implementation of neural machine **translation systems.** 


      These are more flexible than conventional **statistical tools.** They can process more information, which optimizes their autonomous learning (deep learning), adapting to the semantics of each scope.

       This produces higher quality results with fewer **lexical and grammatical errors,** minimizing post-editing work and saving the translator's time.

       This allows the linguist to focus on revising complex expressions and forget about the most tedious work.

aplicacions:
  - descripcio: >-
      "The **applications are very diverse**, given that one of the features of
      neural network translation engines is their versatility. 


      This allows them to adapt to multiple domains, such as: Scientific and technical: translation of industrial technical texts and those **related to technical databases** (patents) or specific fields of knowledge (medical, pharmaceutical, legal, economic, software, etc.). 


      Public administration: translation of texts produced by governments (regulatory or not). Publishing: translation of **publications and literary texts**. 


      Marketing: translation of the promotional or informative materials of **companies and institutions**."
