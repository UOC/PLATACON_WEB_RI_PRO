about:
  - descripcio: >-
      SMARTCLOCKS is a method capable of **maintaining synchronization** between
      devices that have limited opportunities for re-synchronization with an
      accuracy of up to 0.1 ppm. 


      The solution combines the sporadic synchronization of the clock, which takes place during data transmissions, with a correction whose calculation takes into account the prediction of the time drift due to temperature, based on t**he device's thermal characterization.**

  - descripcio: >-
      SmartClocks offers the **following advantages**: 


      \- Automatic synchronization: dispense with packet-based synchronization and the use of external sources such as GPS 


      \- Improves on current **high-accuracy** wireless network synchronization solutions by up to 10 times (0.1 ppm) 


      \- Minimizes **communication overhead** caused by synchronization problems 


      \- Optimizes TDMA network reliability with 100% efficiency


      \- Low-cost solution 


      \- Consumes up to **30% less power**
