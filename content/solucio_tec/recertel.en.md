  - descripcio: >-
      SLI affects **the acquisition of oral language without any accompanying
      cognitive**, anatomical, neurological or social deficits. 7% of children
      are affected by SLI and 60-80% of children with a history of SLI
      experience reading difficulties and low academic progress in
      preadolescence. It is, therefore, a disorder that is very closely
      associated with school failure. 


      The services that RecerTEL offers are aimed at **three type of targets**: 


      \- Those directly or indirectly affected by the disorder (children and parents). 


      \- Prescribers of services (public bodies and education professionals). 


      \- Clinical professionals (psychologists, doctors, speech therapists...).
