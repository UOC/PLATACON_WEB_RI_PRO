      Studying electronic technology has always been associated with **the use
      of on-site laboratories** where a teacher guides students in the use of
      the various devices, assemblies and measuring instruments in order to
      acquire professional knowledge and competencies.


      The technological progress **made in recent decades** has led to significant changes in pedagogical teaching-learning models, opening the door to the virtual (or distance) teaching of technological competencies, including those in the field of electronics. 


      Currently, in both in-person and online models, the student is the fundamental pillar of the teaching-learning process and it is essential to **provide new tools** for the acquisition of these competencies. Consequently, there is a need for a device that at least partially solves the aforementioned problems. 


      **The Component Switching System** (SCC) is a device to remotely create real (not simulated) electronic circuits that has been designed to address the limitations of current products, such as Visir. SCC aims to be a tool for the dynamic choice of electronic elements to create a circuit at low cost, given that the cost of each SCC board is approximately €150, while for other solutions it may be around €1,000. 


      Each SCC board allows the connection of up to 20 two-terminal components or up to 10 three-terminal components to a standard PC without any additional machinery and without any specific equipment, such as National Instruments. 


      Additionally, with its **incorporated connection bus up to 255 arrays** can be connected. It is also easy to use, as it is only necessary to place the components in the array, without having to directly wire them up.
