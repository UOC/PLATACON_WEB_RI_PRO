      Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that expands your vision of the
      real world with digital information (3D animation, audio, images, video,
      internet content). It can be applied to all production sectors and is
      available to anyone with a smartphone or tablet. Viewing this digital
      content requires the use of a mobile device and the application of two
      techniques: geolocation and image recognition. 


      Virtual reality (VR) involves the generation of 3D environments that appear to be real or 360ยบ videos that allow user interaction by means of a device (virtual reality headset or glasses). The UOC specializes in the creation of experiences based on virtual, augmented and mixed reality, especially in the scope of education, health, culture and tourism.
