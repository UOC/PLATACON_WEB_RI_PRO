      **Augmented reality (AR)** is a technology that expands your vision of the
      real world with digital information (3D animation, audio, images, video,
      internet content). It can be applied to all production sectors and is
      available to anyone with a smartphone or tablet. Viewing this digital
      content requires the use of a mobile device and the application of two
      techniques: geolocation and image recognition. 


      **Virtual reality (VR)** involves the generation of 3D environments that appear to be real or 360º videos that allow user interaction by means of a device (virtual reality headset or glasses). The UOC specializes in the creation of experiences based on virtual, augmented and mixed reality, especially in the scope of education, health, culture and tourism.

      **Active Learning:** specialists in immersive learning as a technology
      that allows you to immerse yourself in a different environment and
      experience sensations such as role playing. It transfers people to
      physical environments that are relevant to their learning and develops a
      series of activities to help them acquire certain skills. This technology
      can also be applied to other scopes, such as culture, education and
      tourism. 


      **Health:** immersive experiences can optimize various processes and activities related to health services, such as the training of healthcare professionals, improving empathy and bedside manner, and reducing the perception of chronic or acute pain. This offers a great scope for potential, especially in medical professional training, because we can reduce to zero the negative consequences of mistakes made in training periods, automatically converting them into opportunities for improvement in real life.
