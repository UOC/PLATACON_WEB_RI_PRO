      Lab@Home is a platform developed for the teaching of basic analogue
      electronics skills. 


      This tool allows electronics students to learn hands-on about the design and assembly of electronic circuits and the use of the signal generation devices found in an electronics laboratory. 


      The platform consists of the following elements: 


      * Power supply module, with two switched-mode power supplies and numerous linear regulators, connected to the power supply. 

      * A microcontroller, with two analogue input channels and an analogue output channel, with connection to the computer and the power supply module. 

      * A memory connected to the microcontroller. 

      * A signal generation module connected to the analogue output channel of the microcontroller and to the user module. 

      * A signal capturing module connected to the two analogue input channels of the microcontroller and to the user module. 

      * A user module with a breadboard to allow the user to assemble electronic circuits with connections to the signal capturing module, the signal generation module and the power supply module.

       This system is a step forward in electronic circuit assembly and measuring systems for academic use.

    descripcio: >-
      Lab@Home is hardware that integrates the basic elements of an electronics
      laboratory on a single, small-scale, low-cost board: 


      * protoboard upon which to assemble the circuits 

      * power sources 

      * measuring devices (function generator and digital oscilloscope) 

      * manually variable switching and behaviour components (switch, push-button and multiturn potentiometer). 


      Moreover, the computer software control of the functionalities of the measuring devices included on the board is independent of the programming language or software platform to be used.

      This device is a portable, low-cost analogue electronics laboratory. 


      It can therefore be applied to the online learning of the basic electronics competencies (design and assembly of electronic circuits, and the use of laboratory signal generation and measuring devices) normally acquired in classroom-based teaching. 


      Thanks to its autonomy it can also be used in the classroom to optimize laboratory practicals, as it enables teaching to be adapted to the various paces at which students learn.
