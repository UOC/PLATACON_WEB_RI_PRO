      Tool for the distance teaching of basic analogue electronics skills. It comprises an electronic instrumentation board with PC connectivity and associated software to manage it.[Lab@Home](mailto:Lab@Home)allows the student to learn, through practice, the design and assembly of electronic circuits and the use of the signal generation apparatus of an electronics laboratory, with which they will be able to power the circuits and take measurements with a multimeter and an oscilloscope.

      The solution constitutes a low-cost portable analogue electronics laboratory. It can, then, be applied to the online learning of the basic electronics skills (design and assembly of electronic circuits and the use of the signal generation apparatus of an electronics laboratory) that are acquired in on-site education.


      In addition, its autonomy enables on-site teaching to optimize laboratory practice time, which means it can be tailored to students' different learning paces.
