      Smart Logistics applies simheuristics technology, a family of hybrid algorithms that combine simulation with metaheuristic techniques to solve efficiently complex problems in decision-making under conditions of uncertainty.\

      \

      With the integration of the large optimization capacity of metaheuristic algorithms and the flexibility of simulation, a very powerful, flexible and relatively easily implemented methodology is achieved, which, after proper synchronization, can generate pseudo-optimum solutions for real-life applications and for large-scale problems in scenarios of uncertainty.


      #### [Market](http://transfer.rdi.uoc.edu/en/technological-solution/smart-logistics-integracio-dalgorismes-metaheuristics-amb-resultats-de#collapseOne)


      #### [Innovation](http://transfer.rdi.uoc.edu/en/technological-solution/smart-logistics-integracio-dalgorismes-metaheuristics-amb-resultats-de#collapseTwo)


      The application of the technology allows solutions to be obtained that provide:


      * a reduction in process times and, consequently,

      * a reduction in costs.


      In the specific field of smart cities, optimization also entails:


      * a reduction in public spending (redistributing the saving in other items in the municipal budget),

      * environmental improvement (atmospheric pollution, noise pollution, etc.),

      * an improvement in the management of spaces (car parks, etc.),

      * a reduction in traffic, etc.


      #### [Applications](http://transfer.rdi.uoc.edu/en/technological-solution/smart-logistics-integracio-dalgorismes-metaheuristics-amb-resultats-de#collapseFour)


      This technology can be applied to any industry where there is a need for process optimization with the aim of obtaining cost reductions (monetary, environmental, etc.). Examples of areas in which it can be rolled out are: logistics, transport, production, finances, telecommunication, mobility and smart cities.\

      \

      If we look at the field of smart cities, Smart Logistics can be applied to urban solid waste collection management. The technology, in combination with various traceability and measuring devices, enables a dynamic waste collection focus to be developed. Having real-time information about the replacement levels of dumpsters can be used to optimize waste management planning and therefore improve loading and unloading times, with the subsequent translation into a reduction of the associated costs , environmental impact, traffic levels, etc.\

      \

      Other areas that could benefit from the technology in the field of smart cities are: urban mobility planning, dynamic traffic management, public transport planning, car park management dynamics, etc.

      The type of algorithms generated using this technology is especially suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), that cannot afford a department to manage decision-taking in logistics and transport, providing them with a powerful tool to enable them to be more competitive in the market.\

      \

      In the field of smart cities the technology would be suited to all businesses that provide operations and maintenance services, transport services, etc. in towns and cities.
