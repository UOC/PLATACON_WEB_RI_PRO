      SpeakApps represents an innovative language teaching solution with online tools and materials designed specifically for language students to be able to practise and improve oral skills when learning a language. SpeakApps consists of four tools:


      * Langblog: Audio/Videoblog designed for oral activity learning

      * Tandem: Tool that enables students to carry out pair work to foster oral practice. It distributes materials in real time to enhance interaction between the students.

      * Videochat: Tool that allows videoconferencing sessions with up to six people, helping the students organize and record sessions without the teacher present and allowing the teacher to listen to and assess the individual interventions of each participant.

      * Open Educational Resources (OER): Online language teaching activities and materials creation and editing tool that includes a repository of materials with a Creative Commons licence.


      The four tools can easily be integrated into any educational platform compatible with the IMS LTI standard.


      In addition, the SpeakApps Community, aimed at language teachers, learning technologies developers and all types of language learning-related institutions, promotes the contribution and exchange of language teaching contents, services and teaching methodologies.

      SpeakApps allows activities to be done for online oral language practice that have traditionally been done in person: students and teachers can interact flexibly, easily and intuitively, simplifying interfaces and unifying formats. This improves the education experience, focusing efforts on learning and avoiding dispersion in the use of the technology.\

      \

      It has been shown that by using SpeakApps:


      * students have a greater feeling of belonging to a group, they are more motivated and the quality of speaking skills learning increases.

      * teachers have more powerful tools and resources to promote and assess oral language practice among the students.


      SpeakApps was awarded the silver medal in the Learning Impact 2014 awards, organized by the[IMS Global Learning Consortium](http://www.imsglobal.org/), a non profit-making organization that seeks to promote the growth and impact of learning technologies in higher education.

      SpeakApps is initially designed for distance language teaching, but it can also be used as oral language reinforcement in on-site or blended models. The UOC offers a series of services so that interested institutions can get the most out of SpeakApps:


      * Integration service on the institution's education platform.

      * SAAS service (access to tools in the cloud if the institution does not have an education platform).

      * Technical support (for installation problems, maintenance, etc.).

      * Educational support (adaptation of activities to online teaching).

      * Training (SpeakApps tools, e-teaching, etc.).

      SpeakApps is especially aimed at institutions in the education sector working in language teaching, such as schools and language learning centres, universities and distance education centres that teach languages.
