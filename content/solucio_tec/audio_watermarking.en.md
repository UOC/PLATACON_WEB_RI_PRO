  text_breu: "Audiowatermarking is a solution to protect, synchronize and control
    broadcast content, improving security, customer participation and analysis.
    It is an effective tool that ensures the transmission and storage of
    multimedia content in real time without affecting the data transfer rate or
    the content seen by the viewer. "

about:
  - descripcio: >-
      Audio Watermarking is a technology **patented in Europe and the United
      States** that consists of a system for the embedding and subsequent
      extraction of audio watermarks in real time for thin client devices
      (smartphone, tablet or computer). 


      A watermark contains unique **identifiers of both the portion of the audio** part from which the mark was extracted and the distribution source to which the content can be credited. 


      The technology makes it possible to hide information that is imperceptible to the **human ear in audio** signals. 


      This information can be extracted with a **smartphone or tablet**.

       The developed system includes **two parts**: 

      the watermark embedding system implemented in a standard computer and a watermark extraction system in mobile devices and tablets.

aspectes_innovadors:
  - descripcio: >-
      What sets Audio Watermarking aside from **other systems** is that its
      embedding is done in the frequency domain (Fourier). 


      Moreover, a resynchronization mark is periodically **inserted into the frequency domain.** 


      The third element that the technology incorporates is a time synchronization signal. 


      Its advantages **are as follows**:


      \- Real-time recovery of embedded watermarks even at distances **over six metres** from the audio transmitter (other latest-generation apps can only recover up to a distance of 1.5 metres). 


      \- High fidelity and effective recovery even in adverse conditions, overcoming transmission distortions and **background noise**. 


      \- Better time synchronization between emitter and receiver, in such a **way that the hidden** content reaches the target at the right time.


      \- High capacity (over 1000 bits per second). 


      \- **No internet** access needed for users to run the system.

aplicacions:
  - descripcio: >-
      Audio Watermarking can have **numerous applications,** such as marking the
      authorship of digital content or the inclusion of advertising in the audio
      signal. **Specifically:** 


      **Media analytics:**


      \- Audience measurements and broadcasting monitoring 


      \- Campaign effectiveness measurement 


      \- Consumer analytics on broadcasting, video on demand and even internet distribution

       **Digital security:**

      \- Digital rights management for video on demand and music


      \- Another layer of security to detect counterfeiting and piracy 


      \- Authentication and confirmation of genuine content

       **Multimedia advertising:** 

      \- Connection of television broadcasts with mobile apps to increase viewer engagement 


      \- Synchronization with advertising in real time on second screens when a programme or advertisement is on air
