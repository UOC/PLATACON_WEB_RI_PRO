  - descripcio: >-
      Azimuth Computing aims to foster the **optimization of the use** of
      surplus renewable energy and offer a way of using it other than storage or
      direct injection into the electricity grid. The solution makes it possible
      to allocate this surplus energy to computing. 


      The system includes a local **computing cluster**, which can be understood to be a local extension of cloud computing infrastructure that operates in accordance with the surplus energy that is locally produced.

       It makes it possible to distribute the energy produced while taking into account parameters such as: scheduled production, possible commercialization revenue, **global energy** usage and spending, generation forecasts and consumption habits. 

      This option opens up a completely new approach to global energy management needs, taking advantage of distribution and location or even transferring computing to where **the energy is produced.**
