    descripcio: >-
      The **Care Respite** system is made up of a camera linked to alert
      software that uses artificial vision to identify dangerous situations for
      dependent people and alert their carers so they can respond. 


      Care Respite allows carers to view and verify the reason for an incident and contact the dependent person via its directional voice option. 


      The system is easy to install and configure, only requiring the camera to be placed in a suitable location and the notification options to be selected in the mobile device to be ready to use.

      Care Respite offers the carers of dependent people the opportunity to
      improve how they organize their time. This system makes it possible for
      them to optimize their time, allowing them to carry out other tasks with
      the peace of mind of being able to check on the dependent person at any
      time and knowing that they will receive an alert in the event of any
      danger. 


      Using Care Respite optimizes their care time, guaranteeing that the dependent person will never be neglected. The system can be adapted to any mobile device and can send alerts to multiple recipients. It is a non-invasive system that does not encroach on the privacy of the dependent person or their companions.
