about:
  - descripcio: >-
      Smart Classroom Project **conducts research and provides advice** and
      assessment in the scope of learning spaces. 


      Smart Classroom's main objective is **co-designing, implementing and assessing** the organization and structure (interior architecture and design) of classroom models, as well as the subspaces that form them and the resources that fill them, paying special attention to the didactic, invisible integration of ICT, **in order to redesign their spaces and improve** learning conditions. 


      Its methodology is based on **three aspects**: 


      Space/Environment: student-centric approach (well-being and learning). 


      Pedagogic: focussed on learning based on scientific evidence.

       Digital: invisible presence of digital tools in learning processes.

      The progress made in the scope of **education and the emergence** of new
      pedagogic proposals and strategies make it necessary to focus research on
      what changes should be made to the configuration and organization of
      learning spaces (mainly classrooms and the subspaces that form and
      surround them), in addition to the conditions, dynamics and methodologies
      developed in these spaces. 


      The latest approaches **to schools and current educational** needs require the configuration and implementation of new learning spaces. 


      Smart Classroom was created **in response to the need** to reconsider the learning spaces necessary to implement new educational methodologies and, above all, to offer physical and emotional well-being to their users. 


      Smart Classroom applies scientific research to shape these changes.
